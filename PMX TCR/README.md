# TCR Payload Decoders



## Legacy (backward compatible)
You can use the legacy payload decoder if you using the **PMX firmware for TCR** on an older **Parametric TCR GEN1** or **Parametric TCR GEN2**.
In this case all fields are in the old format like ```l0_rtl```, ```date1_timestamp``` and changes to your application are minimal.
> Note: Do not use this for new projects
